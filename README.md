# "Pomodoro Technique" Timer

The PomodoroÂ® Technique is a popular time management method.

In its easiest form, it works by breaking your work time into two phases:
- a 25 minutes sprint to work on a single task in focused work mode
- a 5 minutes break

and iterate them as long as you want or need to!

This easy app allows the user to set a 25/5 minutes timer and visualise the timer progress through a colorful progress circle and percentages for both elapsed time and remaining time.

Other components of the intuitive interface are:
- a button to switch between the modes even before the timer has elapsed
- a reset button to restart the timer when needed.
